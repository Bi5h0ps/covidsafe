    <string name="covid_transmission_information">
        People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person
        to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth, which are spread when a person with
        COVID-19 coughs or exhales. These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person.
        Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, and then touching
        their eyes, nose or mouth. People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a
        person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets.
    </string>
    <string name="covid_test_information">
        Anyone with symptoms should be tested, wherever possible.
        People who do not have symptoms but have had close contact with someone who is, or may be,
        infected may also consider testing – contact your local health guidelines and follow their guidance.

            The vaccine is given by an injection (0.5 mL) into the muscle of the arm. For the vaccine to work best, you need to get 2 doses: a single dose and then a second dose one month apart.\nImmunity develops over time. It takes about 2 weeks to develop significant protection against COVID-19. For the greatest protection, you will need the second dose.\nBased on studies in about 30,000 participants, the Moderna COVID-19 vaccine was 94.1% effective in preventing COVID-19 beginning 2 weeks after the second dose.

            The vaccine is given by an injection (0.3 mL) into the muscle of the arm. For the vaccine to work best, you need to get 2 doses: a single dose and then a second dose 21 days later.\nImmunity develops over time. It takes about 2 weeks to develop significant protection against COVID-19. For the greatest protection, you will need the second dose.\nClinical studies showed that, beginning 1 week after the second dose, the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID vaccine was:\n- 95% effective in protecting trial participants aged 16 and above against COVID-19 and\n- 100% effective in participants 12 to 15 years old</item>

            The vaccine is given by 2 separate injections of 0.5 mL each into the muscle of the arm. For the vaccine to work best, you need to get 2 doses: a first dose and then a second dose 4 to 12 weeks later.\nImmunity develops over time. It takes about 2 weeks to develop significant protection against COVID-19. For the greatest protection, you will need the second dose.\nThe AstraZeneca COVID-19 vaccine showed an effectiveness of about 62% in preventing symptomatic COVID-19 disease beginning 2 weeks after the second dose. This effectiveness rate is based on an analysis of results from participants who had received the 2 dose regimen that will be used in Canada.</item>

            Viral vector-based vaccines use a harmless virus, such as an adenovirus, as a delivery system. This “vector” virus is not the virus that causes COVID-19. Adenoviruses are among the viruses that can cause the common cold. There are many different types of adenoviruses, and many have been used as delivery systems for other vector-based vaccines for decades.\nWhen a person is given the vaccine, the vector virus contained within the vaccine produces the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein, which is found on the surface of the virus that causes COVID-19. This protein will not make you sick. It does its job and goes away.\nThrough this process, the body is able to build a strong immune response against the spike protein without exposing you to the virus that causes COVID-19.
