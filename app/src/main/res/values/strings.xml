    <string name="covid_transmission_information">
        People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person
        to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth, which are spread when a person with
        COVID-19 coughs or exhales. These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person.
        Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, and then touching
        their eyes, nose or mouth. People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a
        person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets.
